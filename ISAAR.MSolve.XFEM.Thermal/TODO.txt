1) XFEM 2D multiple inclusions interacting with the same element
	- [DONE] The interface integral must be updated: 
		- Each interface only affects some enrichment node. 
		- Kii(e) = 1/a(e) * N(e)^T*N(e) must have rows/cols that match the enriched dofs for the enrichment corresponding to a(e).
		- Therefore N(e) must be limited to the shape functions of nodes enriched with the enrichment e
		- Then Kii(e) must be assembled into Kii, which has all the enriched dofs as its dimensions.
		- Another option is to use the full N as N(e), but to set as zero the shape functions of zero nodes
	- The usual stiffness matrices Kee, Kes are probably ok, since this mapping is handled by the deformation matrices
	- The method that calculates element-curve intersection should take as parameter, which curve (or enrichement item) this 
	corresponds to. 
		- Not
2) XFEM 2D multiple circular inclusions which intersect each other
3) Resolve singularities using gauss points instead of relative area
4) Near-band level sets
5) Vector Level Set Method:
	- It is near band by default. It has the same complications to implement it though
	- Much better approximation of curved interfaces
		- The 2nd option of interpolation from Ventura's paper is straightforward and much more accurate than regular LSM. 
			- What happens if nodes are on both sides of the interface?
		- The 3rd option is also very promising
			- It is independent of shape functions and their order
			- The circle fitting idea could be extended to other shapes: ellipsis or general curves
			- Circle fitting could be combined with a triangular mesh. 
				- The initial mesh could be structured with Tri3 elements
				- Even better, after locating the elements that interact with the interface, refine them!
					- Refining them is easy, since they are triangles
					- Not sure about the accuracy of such a refinement
	- Needs formulas for identifying element - curve intersection in natural/cartesian system
	- Needs formulas for identifying conforming triangulation in natural/cartesian system
	- Needs formulas for identifying curve-curve intersection in natural/cartesian system
