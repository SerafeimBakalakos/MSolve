1) Investigate why changing IDs (e.g 1000, 2000, 3000 instead of 1,2,3) also changes the result
2) Implement the case where a boundary foes through the common edge of 2 elements
3) Heat flux field should be calculated using the basis functions for points not on the boundary. For points on the boundary 
	q=-c*[[T]] should be used. This is the same on both sides of the boundary.
4) Plotting classes should be standardized. Right now there are Fields and Plotters which do the same thing.
